## Terminal  
```
sudo apt-get install python-picamera
nano previewexample.py
python previewexample.py
```
  
## What it does?
1. It first installs python-picamera so we can use the supersimple camera module that we get for Raspberry Pi (ignore first step if already installed).   
2. Then we write the python code in nano. **See previewexample.py**, That's the code I wrote.  
3. Finally we execute the code with python previewexample.py and the camera module previews the video in real time. It looks the same as when we open our webcam and see our real time preview but it's performed with a code and made possible using Raspberry Pi.
